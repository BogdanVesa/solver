# Solver

This is an app for Android that can help a pupil to solve simple equations. The app asks the user questions that have the purpose to help him to go to the next step in solving  the problem.</br>
For solving the equations I used an expression tree. It helped to manipulate the equations and made solving them easier to solve because of its properties, specifically where are the parentheses in the equations and the order of operations.</br>
